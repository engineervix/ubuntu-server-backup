## Introduction

This is a custom backup script to automate the process of backing up databases, files, configurations, etc. for **web applications** running on an Ubuntu server. These applications are typically Python projects (Django, Flask, etc.), and the server setup is based on [@engineervix/ubuntu-server-setup](https://github.com/engineervix/ubuntu-server-setup).

### Important ‚ö†Ô∏è

1. This script is NOT a comprehensive backup solution, **it's certainly not the one backup solution to rule them all**, and it doesn't backup your entire server. If you want a more comprehensive backup solution, then you might wanna consider solutions like [Bacula](https://www.bacula.org/). I'd also recommend that you check out the Ubuntu Community Help Wiki, there's [a section on backing up your system](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BackupYourSystem).
2. This script is NOT meant to replace other backup regimes that you may have, but rather, to complement them. Most cloud server providers (Digital Ocean, Linode, Hetzner, AWS, Vultr, etc.) have **automatic backups** (typically ‚â§20% of server cost) and **snapshots** (a couple of cents per GB per month). I highly recommend that you enable such services, your future self will thank you!
3. This script was put together as a "quick hack" to address the particular need mentioned in the opening paragraph of this introductory section. It is not perfect, but "[_it works on my machine(s)_](https://www.kevinwanke.com/why-you-should-never-use-the-phrase-but-it-works-on-my-machine/)"! While I've taken great care to ensure things work, I may not have accounted for every edge case, so use it with caution. Test it on a temporary server first, and make necessary modifications to suit your situation. If your modifications could benefit the community, then please be a good netizen and [send a PR](https://github.com/engineervix/ubuntu-server-backup/pulls)!

## Features ‚ú®

- specify backup directories and other configurations through a `config.toml` file. See the [sample file](config.sample.toml)
- uses [rclone](https://rclone.org/) to sync your backups to a cloud provider of your choice
- run the script via **cron**
- timestamps your backups
- automatically deletes backups older than 10 days (of course you can change this to whatever number of days you want)
- backs up the following:
  - all your project files
  - all PostgreSQL databases
  - redis data & configuration
  - list of installed `apt` and `snap` packages
  - list of globally installed `python3` packages
  - list of globally installed npm packages
  - all your Python virtual environments (names + installed packages for each)
  - your `.bashrc`, `.zshrc` and `.vimrc.after` files
  - crontabs
  - postfix configuration
  - configs for `fail2ban`, `logwatch`, `apticron`, `unattended-upgrades`, `nginx`, `uwsgi`, `letsencrypt` & `sshd`.

## Usage üöÄ

> **Before you get started**
>
> As already mentioned, the server setup is based on <https://github.com/engineervix/ubuntu-server-setup>, so if you're backing up stuff on such a server, you don't need to install anything to use the script, because all the required dependencies are already installed.
>
> However, if your server setup is different, you can have a quick idea of the dependencies just by skimming through the script before running, and also check out the server setup docs: <https://ubuntu-server-setup.readthedocs.io/en/latest/02_features.html>. Some noteworthy dependencies include [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) and [yq](https://kislyuk.github.io/yq/) for reading the `.toml` config file and other formats like `.json`.
>
> Regardless of your server setup, you need to configure [rclone](https://rclone.org/) with your choice(s) of cloud storage.

‚å®Ô∏è The backup script (`backup.sh`) reads from a configuration file, `config.toml`. To get started, you can either clone this repo or just download `backup.sh` and `config.sample.toml`. Here's an example of the latter:

```bash
wget https://github.com/engineervix/ubuntu-server-backup/raw/main/backup.sh && \
wget https://github.com/engineervix/ubuntu-server-backup/raw/main/config.sample.toml && \
mv -v config.sample.toml config.toml && \
chmod +x backup.sh
```

‚å®Ô∏è As you can see in the last line above, we are ensuring that the script is executable (just in case).

‚å®Ô∏è Now, edit your `config.toml` accordingly.

‚å®Ô∏è You can run this script manually (`./backup.sh` if you're in the same directory, or `/path/to/backup.sh` if calling the script from somewhere else), but you probably wanna run it via `cron`, as `root`. For example, to run it at 3:18AM everyday, your crontab entry will look like: `18 3 * * * /path/to/backup.sh`. Here's another example, with redirection of output to timestamped log file.

```bash
# 18 3 * * * /path/to/backup.sh >> /path/to/backup_`date +\%Y\%m\%d_\%H\%M\%S`.log 2>&1
```

## Supported Ubuntu versions üñ•Ô∏è

This has been **tested on Ubuntu 20.04**, I don't know if it'll work correctly on other versions.

## TODO ‚úÖ

- [X] Include celery configurations
- [ ] do *incremental* backups using [duplicity](https://duplicity.gitlab.io/duplicity-web/index.html)
- [ ] Backup any additional custom Python virtual environment configs (virtualenvwrapper)
- [ ] Include other *dotfiles* (such as `~/.profile`, etc.)
- [ ] add email/SMS/telegram/slack notifications on failure (actually, just use <https://healthchecks.io/>)
- [ ] split each backup task into a standalone function
- [ ] run automated tests using [Bash Automated Testing System](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core)
