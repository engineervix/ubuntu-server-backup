## Introduction

This is a custom backup script to automate the process of backing up databases, files, configurations, etc. for **web applications** running on an Ubuntu server. These applications are typically Python projects (Django, Flask, etc.), and the server setup is based on [@engineervix/ubuntu-server-setup](https://github.com/engineervix/ubuntu-server-setup).

## Features ‚ú®

- specify backup directories and other configurations through a `config.toml` file. See the [sample file](config.sample.toml)
- uses [rclone](https://rclone.org/) to sync your backups to a cloud provider of your choice
- run the script via **cron**
- timestamps your backups
- automatically deletes backups older than 10 days (of course you can change this to whatever number of days you want)
- backs up the following:
  - all your project files
  - all PostgreSQL databases
  - redis data & configuration
  - list of installed `apt` and `snap` packages
  - list of globally installed `python3` and `python2` packages
  - list of globally installed npm packages
  - all your Python virtual environments (names + installed packages for each)
  - your `.bashrc`, `.zshrc` and `.vimrc.after` files
  - crontabs
  - postfix configuration
  - configs for `fail2ban`, `logwatch`, `apticron`, `unattended-upgrades`, `nginx`, `uwsgi`, `letsencrypt` & `sshd`.

## Usage üöÄ

> **Before you get started**
>
> As already mentioned, the server setup is based on <https://github.com/engineervix/ubuntu-server-setup>, so if you're backing up stuff on such a server, you don't need to install anything to use the script, because all the required dependencies are already installed.
>
> However, if your server setup is different, you can have a quick idea of the dependencies just by skimming through the script before running, and also check out the server setup docs: <https://ubuntu-server-setup.readthedocs.io/en/latest/02_features.html>. Some noteworthy dependencies include [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) and [yq](https://kislyuk.github.io/yq/) for reading the `.toml` config file and other formats like `.json`.
>
> Regardless of your server setup, you need to configure [rclone](https://rclone.org/) with your choice(s) of cloud storage.

‚å®Ô∏è The backup script (`backup.sh`) reads from a configuration file, `config.toml`. To get started, you can either clone this repo or just download `backup.sh` and `config.sample.toml`. Here's an example of the latter:

```bash
wget https://github.com/engineervix/ubuntu-server-backup/blob/main/backup.sh && \
wget https://github.com/engineervix/ubuntu-server-backup/blob/main/config.sample.toml && \
mv -v config.sample.toml config.toml
```

‚å®Ô∏è Now, edit your `config.toml` accordingly.

‚å®Ô∏è You can run this script manually (`./backup.sh` if you're in the same directory, or `/path/to/backup.sh` if calling the script from somewhere else), but you probably wanna run it via `cron`, as `root`. For example, to run it at 3:18AM everyday, your crontab entry will look like: `18 3 * * * /path/to/backup.sh`

## Supported Ubuntu versions

I had Ubuntu 20.04 in mind when writing this, so I don't know if it'll work correctly on other versions.

## TODO ‚úÖ

- [ ] do *incremental* backups using <https://duplicity.gitlab.io/duplicity-web/index.html>
- [ ] Backup any additional custom Python virtual environment configs (virtualenvwrapper)
- [ ] Include other *dotfiles* (such as `.profile`, etc.)
- [ ] add email/SMS/telegram/slack notifications on failure (actually, just use <https://healthchecks.io/>)
- [ ] split each backup task into a standalone function
- [ ] run automated tests
